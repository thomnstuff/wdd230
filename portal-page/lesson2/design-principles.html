                <p>To be honest, I used a search engine to find an example of a website that showed good color schemes along with Contrast.
                    Though it's mostly an animated, it still manages to hold on to a complimentery colors set (though I think 
                    there may be more than the suggested five) that creates an eye popping and pleasent expereince. It has good visual hierarchy
                    and the colors don't interact with the fonts in a negative way that prevents readablility.
                    I don't know what the purpose of this site is, I've never been on it before,
                    but I found it to be a good example of such things non-the-less.

                <p>
                    I think this site exemplifies Visual Hierarchy well enough. With the main purpose
                    of this site being a means to locate trails. The first thing you see is the important
                    option of typing either your location or, if you know what you want, the name of the 
                    trail you are looking for. For those that don't know what they want, there are options
                    below that arent oversized enough to distract from the main search option.

                <p>This website (like most webistes I've encountered) provides a decent example of Alignment.
                    With a F Pattern design (mostly) The information that is most important is situated mostly from left to right, with the most important
                    information located along the top, then below that, the content located primarly on the left. It allows for a natural
                    expereince of skimming through the page. I think I could've found a better example, but I'm allready
                    late on this asignment as it is. That being said, I think this site still exemplifies Alignment and design well enough.
