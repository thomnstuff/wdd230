        <h2>Tartget Audience Info</h2>
        <p>
            The Target audience for this web-site is anyone really. We welcome folks of any age (though preferably, 
            we don't want no-folks over the age of 90 or under the age 5) to come learn from your community. So! If you
            got the drive to learn, or to take a chance and teach a course yourself (you'd be surprised by what people 
            are willing to learn).

        </p>
        
        <h2>The Local Personas</h2>
        <h3>Sandy</h3>
        <p>
            93 year-old Sandy Cheeks is mother of twelve and part time worker at the local pub and grocery store.
            She often looks to the sky and wonders if there's more to life than just deterring knife fights 
            and trapping raccoons out-back. So Sandy decided, in her spare time, to teach a course in Hypnotism and Social Engineering.
            She carries a big stick and is very willing to use it when provoked. We all love Sandy and her cheeky antics!
        </p>
        <h3>Timmy</h3>
        <p>
            Little Timmy O Tool, the local orphan boy, is a rambunctious little skat, always getting into all
            kinds of mischief. At just four years old, he devolved a yearning for the learning (he can't be dancing
            for nickels for all his life). So, you'll likely see Ol Timmy making his way in the local class that are 
            provided for the community. If you see Ol Timmy O Tool, be sure to flick him a nickel, and you'll have a 
            friend for life
